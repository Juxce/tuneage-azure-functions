Epic,1000000002,2021-09-14T22:35:24.370Z,Epic Records,Edm.String,"Epic Records is a record label launched in 1953 by CBS. Its bright-yellow and black logo became a familiar trademark for many jazz and classical music releases. This has included such notables as the Berlin Philharmonic, the Juilliard String Quartet, Antal Dorati conducting the Hague Philharmonic and George Szell conducting the Cleveland Orchestra. Ten years later, Epic earned its first gold records and developed into a formidable hit-making force in rock, R&B, and country. Among its many acts were Bobby Vinton, Sly and the Family Stone, The Dave Clark Five and Donovan. During the 1970s, the label's success extended to include The Hollies, Edgar Winter ABBA and Tammy Wynette. The 1980s and 1990s saw Epic releasing numerous multi-platinum albums from artists such as Meat Loaf, The Jacksons, Sade, Michael Jackson, Cyndi Lauper and others.",Edm.String,Epic,Edm.String,www.epic.com,Edm.String
